# Data Science and AI Projects
These projects are part of the propaedeutic year at Breda University of Applied Sciences. Not all projects will be included in this repository, as some of them contain sensitive and/or private data. 
Hopefully it will still give you an overall idea of what I can do.

This year I learned several different skills, like programming in Python and performing exporatory data analysis using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. Machine learning and deep learning (neural networks) where one of the main interests I had this year, so working with scikit-learn, Keras and Tensorflow was defenitely part of the daily routine. To access data from different companies I learned how to use PostgreSQL and the basics of working with databases, datalakes and datawarehouses. 

Additionally, to effectively communicate my findings and work with other team-members and investors, I regularly used tools such as PowerBI and Streamlit to make dashboards and visualizations.

## Work/projects will be added soon!
